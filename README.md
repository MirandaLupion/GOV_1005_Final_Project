# GOV_1005_Final_Project
This is my final project for the GOV 1005 (Data) course at Harvard. 

Summary:
The Shiny App displays data about crimes in the Russian Federation's federal subjects (administrative units) from 1990 through 2010. Users can visualize the data interactively in a table, scatterplot, and map. I hope that, through this data exploration, users will realize that Russia is as geographically diverse as the United States. The data also helps communicate changes in crime trends from the tumultuous 1990s period through President Vladimir Putin's first two terms and the first half of Dmitri Medvedev's presidency.
